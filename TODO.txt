TO DO with pipeline

Currently, we normalize by volumes of ROI from the high res structural scans.
Would be better to normalize by volumes in DTI space, based on actual ROI's used. 
This could be easily accomplished through fslstats -V

Apparently there are tools in FSL to do this:
Run eddy_correct on the data, then the ecc.log file is used by
Fdt_rotate_bvecs
We should incorporate this into the pipeline. We were running eddy_correct on the data, but I am not sure if I am still doing that. Never ran fdt_rotate_bvecs
Joe â€“ would be interested to see what this does with some of the higher resolution data sets. However, you will need good slice coverage to get a good registration.


PAUL:
Include CSF mask which should be avoided in tractography.
--avoid=ROIs/CSFmask.nii.gz

ADD multiple parcellation schemes
